# C-ML: Machine Learning in C

This project is a testament to the power and simplicity of the C programming language. It revisits the roots of programming, leveraging the raw performance and control that C provides to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.

The goal of this project is not just to create machine learning models, but to understand the underlying principles and mechanics by building them from the ground up. This journey takes us through the intricacies of data structures, algorithmic complexity, and numerical computation, all in the context of the C language.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

The first stop in this journey is the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification. This simple yet powerful algorithm forms the cornerstone of many machine learning systems.

The KNN project is organized as follows:

- `src/KNN/`: Contains the source code for the KNN algorithm. Key files include:
  - [`knn.c`](src/KNN/knn.c): The main entry point for the program.
  - [`KNN.h`](src/KNN/KNN.h): Header file for the KNN algorithm.
  - [`utils.h`](src/KNN/utils.h): Contains utility functions and structures.
  - [`vector.h`](src/KNN/vector.h): Contains vector-related functions and structures.
  - [`point.h`](src/KNN/point.h): Contains point-related functions and structures.
  - [`dataset.h`](src/KNN/dataset.h): Contains dataset-related functions and structures.
  - [`color.h`](src/KNN/color.h): Contains color-related functions and structures.
  - [`k_d_tree.h`](src/KNN/k_d_tree.h): Contains k-d tree-related functions and structures.
- `build/`: Contains build-related files generated by CMake.

## Decision Tree Project

The Decision Tree project is another key part of this journey. Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter. The tree can be explained by two entities, namely decision nodes and leaves. The leaves are the decisions or the final outcomes. And the decision nodes are where the data is split.

The Decision Tree project is organized as follows:

- `src/DT/`: Contains the source code for the Decision Tree algorithm. Key files include:
  - [`dt.c`](src/DT/dt.c): The main entry point for the program.
  - [`dt.h`](src/DT/dt.h): Header file for the Decision Tree algorithm, which includes the definition of the `DT_Classifier` structure and the `dt_classifier_build` and `dt_classifier_run` functions.
  - `configs/`: Contains configuration files for the Decision Tree algorithm.

To run the Decision Tree algorithm, you need to call the `dt_classifier_run` function. This function initializes a decision tree and a dataset, loads configurations from a YAML file, splits the dataset into training and testing sets, builds the decision tree using the training set, and evaluates the decision tree using the testing set.

The building of the decision tree is done by the `dt_classifier_build` function. This function recursively splits the dataset into two parts according to a threshold that maximizes the information gain, until all data points in each part belong to the same class.

Please refer to the source code in [`dt.c`](src/DT/dt.c) and [`dt.h`](src/DT/dt.h) for more details.
