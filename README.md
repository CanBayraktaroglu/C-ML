# C-ML: Machine Learning in C

This project is a testament to the power and simplicity of the C programming language. It revisits the roots of programming, leveraging the raw performance and control that C provides to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.

The goal of this project is not just to create machine learning models, but to understand the underlying principles and mechanics by building them from the ground up. This journey takes us through the intricacies of data structures, algorithmic complexity, and numerical computation, all in the context of the C language.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

The first stop in this journey is the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification. This simple yet powerful algorithm forms the cornerstone of many machine learning systems.

The KNN project is organized as follows:

- `src/KNN/`: Contains the source code for the KNN algorithm. Key files include:
  - [`main.c`](src/KNN/main.c): The main entry point for the program.
  - [`KNN.h`](src/KNN/KNN.h): Header file for the KNN algorithm.
  - [`utils.h`](src/KNN/utils.h): Contains utility functions and structures.
  - [`vector.h`](src/KNN/vector.h): Contains vector-related functions and structures.
  - [`point.h`](src/KNN/point.h): Contains point-related functions and structures.
  - [`dataset.h`](src/KNN/dataset.h): Contains dataset-related functions and structures.
  - [`color.h`](src/KNN/color.h): Contains color-related functions and structures.
  - [`k_d_tree.h`](src/KNN/k_d_tree.h): Contains k-d tree-related functions and structures.
- `build/`: Contains build-related files generated by CMake.

## Building and Running the Project

This project uses CMake for building. To build and run the project, navigate to the project root directory and follow the instructions in the "Building the Project" section.

## Future Directions

This project is just the beginning. The roadmap includes implementing other machine learning algorithms in C, such as decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. Stay tuned for more!
